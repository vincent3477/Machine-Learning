    "       where people compete to see who can get the best results on a dataset.\n",
    "       It is very popular in the machine learning community and has thousands of datasets with descriptions.\n",
    "       Make sure to read the dataset's description, as Kaggle also has synthetic datasets.\n",
    " - [data.gov](https://data.gov/) -- A portal for data from the US government.\n",
    "        The US government has a lot of data, and much of it has to be available to the public by law.\n",
    "        This portal contains some of the more organized data from several different government agencies.\n",
    "        In general, the government has A LOT of interesting data.\n",
    "        It may not always be clean (remember the CIA factbook), but it is interesting and available.\n",
    "        All data here should be real-world, but make sure to read the description to verify.\n",
    " - [UCI's Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) -- UC Irvine has their own data repository with a few hundred datasets on many different topics.\n",
    "        Make sure to read the dataset's description, as UCI also has synthetic datasets.\n",
    " - [WHO's Global Health Observatory](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.home) -- The World Health Organization keeps track of many different health-related statistics for most of the countries in the world.\n",
    "        All data here should be real-world, but make sure to read the description to verify.\n",
    " - [Google's Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) -- Google indexes many datasets that can be searched here.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can even create a dataset from scratch if you find some data you like that is not already organized into a specific dataset.\n",
