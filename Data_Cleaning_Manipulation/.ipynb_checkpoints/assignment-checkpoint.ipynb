    "# Hands-On Assignment 3\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will learn the basics of data cleaning and munging (manipulation).\n",
    "Data is the heart and soul of a data scientist and machine learner.\n",
    "Therefore, it is important for you to get comfortable taking data from its natural, messy state\n",
    "to a state where it is ready for machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since data is at the core of all we do, we learn to love data and treat it well.\n",
    "However, not everyone is a data scientist, a computer scientist, or even a programmer.\n",
    "Others that you work with may carefully collect very important data,\n",
    "but handling and storing the data may not be their expertise.\n",
    "So whenever working with data prepared by others,\n",
    "we must always treat their data with care and remember that even data presented in suboptimal ways can be of the utmost importance.\n",
    "Also remember that even as we learn better data handling practices,\n",
    "there will still be those with data handling skill and methodologies that are leagues better than our own.\n",
    "(It's database people, they are usually the best data people. (Written by Eriq, a database person.))\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this assignment is for you to learn about:\n",
    " - Finding errors and inconsistencies in data.\n",
    " - Extracting key pieces of information from a data column.\n",
    " - Assigning types to data columns.\n",
    " - Understanding and finding outliers in your data.\n",
    " - Replacing missing pieces of data.\n",
    " - Encoding data.\n",
    " - Joining data."

    "Besides outliers, another form of anomalous data we may see are *missing values*.\n",
    "Missing values may be represented in many different ways depending on the dataset:\n",
    "numpy.nan, -1, null, None, \"MISSING\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes what to do with missing data is obvious given the dataset.\n",
    "For example, if a new country was founded in 2022 then the value in its \"Unemployment rate 2019\" should be missing.\n",
    "Neither a 0.0 nor 1.0 would make sense, the value just does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "However in more complex situations, deciding what to do with missing data can be very difficult.\n",
    "One potential way to deal with missing data is through [data imputation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputation_(statistics)).\n",
    "\"Imputing\" data is when we replace missing values with some derived value.\n",
    "We are essentially \"filling in the gaps\" in our data with values that make sense.\n",
    "There are many methods of choosing which values to impute, some of which are:\n",
    " - Using the **mean** value of the column (using non-empty values).\n",
    " - Using other values to create a machine learning model (often a regressor) to **predict** what the value should be.\n",
    " - Making a **random** guess (which can sometimes work better than you may expect).\n",
    " - Using knowledge of the domain to build a probabilistic model and then using that model to make a **educated random** guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no fixed rule or theorem that will tell you what the best data imputation method is for each dataset or column.\n",
    "It will usually come down to the expertise of a data scientists (that's you!)\n",
    "to bridge the gap between the domain data and statistics and figure our the best way to impute missing data (or whether to leave it be).\n",
    "Always be careful when imputing values,\n",
    "since it may bias your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our data, the most sparsely populated columns (and candidates for imputation)\n",
    "are \"Literacy\" and the three \"Unemployment\" columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Literacy\" column could be a very interesting column to impute,\n",
    "because there are many [studies on different predictors of literacy in adults](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0243763).\n",
    "We may be able to use the other columns in our dataset (like \"Electricity access\", \"Internet access\", \"Improved Sanitation\", \"Improved Water\")\n",
    "to predict literacy rate.\n",
    "Unfortunately, building regressors is outside the scope of this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, the \"Unemployment\" columns also provides an interesting data imputation opportunity for us.\n",
    "There are three columns that represent employment for three years (\"Unemployment rate 2021\", \"Unemployment rate 2020\", \"Unemployment rate 2019\"),\n",
    "and each country may have values for any number of those columns.\n",
    "To smooth out the data and impute missing values,\n",
    "we can combine these columns into one (\"Recent Unemployment\") and take the **mean** of all present values."

    "Let's finally deal with that pesky \"Export commodities\" column!\n",
    "It's not a number, but represents a list of items.\n",
    "It is common to deal with data that is not numeric (arbitrary strings, strings representing single items, strings representing list/sets of items, etc).\n",
    "To deal with these non-numeric columns, we need to encode them.\n",
    "That is, we need to convert them from a non-numeric form to a numeric one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, there are many encodings and encoding methods.\n",
    "An encoding that you are probably already familiar with is [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII),\n",
    "which is a way to represent Latin letters as numbers.\n",
    "Encodings are just agreed upon ways to represent non-numeric values as numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning and data science, probably the most popular encoding method is [the One-Hot encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot).\n",
    "In One-Hot encoding, we take all the possible values an item can take and assign each possible value an index.\n",
    "Presence of that value results in a 1, which absence results in a 0.\n",
    "Essentially, we are turning a list of items into a series of binary columns which ask \"Do you have this value?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following tables.\n",
    "In the first one, a student's major is kept as a string (or a list of strings).\n",
    "To encode it, a column is created for each possible major and a 1 is present if that student has that major\n",
    "(otherwise a 0 is used).\n",

    "## Part 4: Joining Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is not always from a single frame/table or source.\n",
    "You will often need to merge and cross-reference data from other sources and in different frames.\n",
    "When we talk about merging data from multiple frames or tables,\n",
    "we usually use terminology that comes from databases and relational algebra.\n",
    "So we say \"table\" to refer to the abstract concept of tabular data (data with rows and columns) like a Pandas.DataFrame.\n",
    "Then, a [join](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_(SQL)) is an operation that combines data from the columns of two different tables.\n",
    "(Note that the same table can actually be used multiple times (called a \"self-join\"),\n",
    "and joins can be chained together to include as many tables as desired.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will briefly show the main different types of joins.\n",
    "The image below shows a graphical representation of the primary join types.\n",
    "When discussing joins, we will refer to the table on the left side of the join operator as the LHS (left-hand side)\n",
    "and the table on the right side of the join operator as the RHS (right-hand side).\n",
    "In the diagram below, $ A $ is always the LHS and $ B $ is always the RHS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Joins will typically specify some condition that must be meant for two rows to be merged,\n",
    "referred to as a \"join condition\".\n",
    "The most common join condition is equality for a set of columns.\n",
    "When a collection of columns are checked for equality in a join,\n",
    "we say we join \"on\" those columns.\n",
    "For example, we may say that we join $ A $ and $ B $ on the \"ID\" column.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"joins.png\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross Join / Cartesian Product / Cross Product\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross joins (also known an \"Cartesian products\" or \"cross products\")\n",
    "are when every row in the LHS is paired with every row in the RHS.\n",
    "Therefore, the resulting table will have $ |A| * |B| $ number of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross joins can be though of as the basis for all other joins,\n",
    "since all possible rows are enumerated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inner Join\n",
    "\n",
    "Inner joins take only the rows from the LHS and RHS where the join conditions are met.\n",
    "We call an inner join where all shared columns (columns with the same name) between the LHS and RHS are checked for equality a *natural join*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full Outer Join\n",
    "\n",
    "Full outer joins (also known as \"outer joins\") ensure that every row from each table is represented.\n",
    "First, rows where the join condition are met are included.\n",
    "Then, rows from each table are included where the join condition are not met are included.\n",
    "For these non-matching rows, any columns that come from the other table are filled in with null or empty values\n",
    "(depending on the engine that performs the join).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Left Outer Join\n",
    "\n",
    "Left outer joins are like full outer joins,\n",
    "except only the non-matching rows from the LHS are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Right Outer Join\n",
    "\n",
    "Left outer joins are like full outer joins,\n",
    "except only the non-matching rows from the RHS are included."
